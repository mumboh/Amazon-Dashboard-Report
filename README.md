**Amazon Sales Performance Dashboard | Power BI**

This project involves the development of an interactive business intelligence dashboard using Power BI to analyze Amazon sales performance across multiple dimensions, including time, region, product category, customer tier, and segment.

Raw transactional data was cleaned, transformed, and modeled to support efficient querying and dynamic analysis, enabling accurate tracking of sales, profitability, ROI, and operational performance.

**Technical Highlights**

**Data Modeling**
Applied dimensional modeling principles to support efficient aggregations
Optimized relationships for cross-filtering and drill-down analysis

**DAX Measures & Logic**
Built dynamic KPI measures for:
Total Sales
Total Profit
Profit Margin
Orders
Average Order Value (AOV)
Return on Investment (ROI)

Implemented conditional formatting using DAX to dynamically update KPI indicators (Green/Red)
based on performance trends and negative profit values

**Visual Analytics**
Donut Chart: Sales by Segment
Map Visual: Regional Sales Distribution
Line Chart: Profit Margin Trends by Year
Bar Chart: Sales by Customer Tier
Treemap: Sales by Product Category
Combined Bar Chart: Top 10 Products by Sales and Profit
Waterfall Chart: Category Contribution to Overall Profit
Matrix Table: Segment-level KPIs (Sales, Profit, Margin, Average Sales)

**Interactivity**
Implemented slicers for Customer Tier, Segment, Category, and Date
Enabled cross-filtering across all visuals
Dynamic recalculation of KPIs based on user-selected filters

**Tools & Technologies**
Power BI Desktop
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
Power Query (ETL & data transformation)
Data Visualization & Dashboard Design

**Outcome**
The dashboard provides a comprehensive analytical view of sales and profitability, allowing stakeholders to identify top-performing products, monitor profitability trends, and detect performance declines in real time. This project demonstrates practical expertise in BI development, analytical modeling, and data-driven decision support.
